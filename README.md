# schred

schred is a Rust implementation of the [GNU shred](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/shred-invocation.html) utility. For now the goal is to have a super-set of the GNU shred features. [schred_lib](https://github.com/Karta775/schred_lib) contains the logic, this package is just the frontend.
